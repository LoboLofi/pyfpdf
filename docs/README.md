# Documentation Hosting folder

The contents of this folder are generated with `tox -e docs` except for
`index.html`. Styling input is welcome there ofc.

Any non-automatically generated and separately maintained documentation should
be added into a seperate folder that is ignored by `MANIFEST.in` such that it
is not packaged with a source distribution of this package (but available
through hosting elsewhere on a different service, maybe like readthedocs).
